# malencrypt

Encrypts every files in a the Linux directory ran, except the script itself, files made by this script, and any directories. File is made to be deleted after encryption and then reinstated for decryption.

THIS FILE CREATES TWO FILES THAT MUST REMAIN WHERE THEY ARE WHEN USER WANTS TO DECRYPT FILES

THE PASSWORD FILE IS CREATED IN THE DIRECTORY THE PROGRAM IS RAN
THE KEY FILE IS CREATED IN THE DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY OF THE CURRENT USER

CURRENT USER IS THE ONLY USER WHO HAS ANY PRIVLEDGES ON KEY FILE
PASSWORD FILE IS ENCRYPTED WITH KEY AND PERMISSIONS SET

MY FIRST PROGRAM THAT DOES SOMETHING USEFUL HORRAY!
